## INTRODUTION

- This Project contains a python file to detect hands and Play Rock Paper And Scissors with an AI
- Who wants to use it in his/her project for detection hands and play this game.
- Once you Press S then it will count down to 3 then will display what the AI chooses and Score will increase accordingly
- At the End the Score Will be printed
- This Module uses mainly openCV (cv2) library of python for video and other detections
- Also contains Library cvzone for all the image processing
- ***First You need to install some modules to run this file***





## Installation

Go to your Cmd or Python Shell or Anaconda Prompt (if using spyder or Jupyter)

**You need to install 2 Libraries**
- OpenCV (cv2)
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install cvzone
```

Once it is installed you are good to run the Script or can call it in your own project
:thumsup:

**This Project needs a Hand Detection File which is porvided in the project or you can download from**
```bash
https://github.com/VedantRaj3907/Hand-Detection-And-Tracking-Module-Python-OpenCV
```

- Or You can just write this line of code to import in your Counting_Fingers.py file (if not presented)
```bash
